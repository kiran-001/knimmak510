\title{Calculate and Plot Survival Curve}
\usage{
survCurv(status, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{status}{Numeric vector indicating the event occurrence (1 = event, 0 = censored).}

\item{time}{Numeric vector of times at which the events or censorship occur.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the survival curve.
}
\description{
This function calculates the survival curve S(t) using the Kaplan-Meier estimator from
survival analysis, and plots the curve using ggplot2. The function requires two vectors:
one for the status (1 if the event of interest has occurred, 0 otherwise), and one for
the time until the event occurs or censorship.
}
\examples{
# Assume data is loaded where 'status' and 'time' are defined
survCurv(status, time)

}
